# etch-a-sketch

The goal of this project was to practice using vanilla JavaScript to to create a grid of Divs. There is an option to change the size of the grid and the color scheme all using JavaScript using JS.

## How it works

### Classic
when you hover over a div it will change color. While in the classic mode (default on load) the div will become darker. Pass over the same div it will incrementally get darker with each pass until it has reached its darkest color.

### Colorful

Pressing the "Colorful" button will change the color scheme from the classic to each mouseover event changing the color to a different hue completely. Passing over the same div will result in the div taking a new color.

### Reset

The reset button will clear the etch-a-sketch field and allow you to choose a new grid size. The default is 16x16 so choosing higher than "16" will result in more div cells than the default.

The range for the grid is limited between 1 and 100.
