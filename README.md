# etch-a-sketch
Etch-a-Sketch Javascript

This is a project from The Odin Project to practice javaScript. The basic goal is to create a grid of Divs using JS and when you hover they will change color. Additional steps are to allow incremental increase in the opacity so the cell will darken each time you pass over it. Additional features include a multi-color/rainbow option, the ability to reset the grid, and the option to resize the grid within the same area. This allows the cells to be displayed bigger or smaller depending on how many are aded within the grid.
